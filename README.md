# hacktivism-cybersecurity-research-coss

This repository documents an undergraduate security-focused research project
presented at the **Celebration of Student Scholars (COSS)** at Concordia College – Moorhead. COSS is a campus-wide academic symposium where students present original research
to faculty, peers, and the broader college community.

This project was completed collaboratively as part of a course and culminated in
a formal poster presentation at COSS. The research examines historical, cultural,
and legal dimensions of hacking and hacktivism, with an emphasis on adversarial
behavior in networked systems.

In addition to research and analysis, the project emphasized **public speaking
and technical communication**, including presenting findings, responding to live
questions, and clearly explaining cybersecurity concepts to a **non-technical
audience**.

**Context:** Completed as part of *Introduction to Computer Security* (Spring 2024)
at Concordia College – Moorhead.
